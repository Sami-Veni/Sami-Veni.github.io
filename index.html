            Hello People, nowadays things are getting a bit harsh because of several bad sitiations
            such as COVID-19 natural disasters, political conflicts social media and so on. But don't 
            lose hope. God has plans for every thing. He will make things better when it's time. As the 
            wise King Solomon once said, 'There is time for everything.'
